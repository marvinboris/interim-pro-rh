With over 250 ethnic groups, each with its own language, customs, and traditions, Cameroon is a melting pot of cultures. From the Bamileke people of the West Region to the Tikar of the North, the Fulani of the Far North to the Duala of the Littoral Region, every corner of Cameroon offers a unique cultural experience. Despite this diversity, Cameroonians share a strong sense of national identity, united by their love for their country and pride in their heritage.`,
